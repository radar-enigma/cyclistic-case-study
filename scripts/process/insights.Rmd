### üîç Strategic Revenue Insights: Casual vs. Member Riders

<br>

#### This analysis challenges the assumption that increasing membership alone drives profitability and raises operational concerns around unrestricted membership growth.

<br>

### I. Key Revenue Findings

Supporting points:

1. Member trip duration doesn't directly impact revenue (flat-rate model).  
2. Member revenue scales only with the number of subscribers.  
3. Casuals pay per ride‚Äîthe more they ride, the more revenue.  
4. The ride data clearly demonstrates a higher overall revenue contribution from casual riders when compared to annual members.

<br>

#### üîπ Support for Point #4: "Casuals outperform members in revenue contribution"

Although the dataset does not include direct financial figures, we can still derive meaningful revenue estimates by analyzing rider behavior and usage statistics, then mapping these patterns onto widely accepted pricing models used by bike-share systems globally.

To estimate casual rider revenue, we do not need to know the exact number of users. Since casuals are charged per minute, we can simply multiply their total ride minutes by the standard per-minute rate.

In contrast, estimating member revenue requires an indirect approach. By analyzing ride frequency and behavior patterns, we can approximate the number of active members. This estimated population is then multiplied by the annual membership fee to calculate total revenue.

**Reference Chart 1 ‚Äì Hourly Distribution of Rides by Rider Type (Percentage of Total)**
This chart illustrates the hourly breakdown of ride activity by rider type. Member usage shows clear peaks between 7‚Äì9 AM and 5‚Äì7 PM, aligning with typical commuting hours. A secondary rise appears between 12‚Äì2 PM, likely reflecting midday errands or lunch breaks. These patterns reinforce the assumption that many members use the system as part of a structured daily routine.

**Reference Chart 2 ‚Äì Daily Ride Percentage**
This chart highlights member ride distribution across the week. Member activity remains consistently high on weekdays, reflecting common commuting behavior. However, weekend usage is also notable‚Äîthis may indicate continued use for personal or leisure trips, or that some members maintain non-traditional work schedules and commute on weekends as well.
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Estimating the Number of Members

To estimate the number of subscribed members, we begin by analyzing observable behavioral patterns in the ride data.

**Important Note:**

The estimated number of members should not exceed the available fleet size of 5,824 bikes. If member demand surpasses this capacity, it would leave limited or no availability for casual riders‚Äîcreating operational strain and reducing system accessibility.

#### 1 Hourly Usage Patterns

**How many times does a member ride per day?**

Reference Chart 1 strongly supports the assumption that a typical member uses the system at least twice per day‚Äîonce in the morning and once in the evening. This pattern aligns with common commuting routines and suggests that individual members frequently make multiple rides each day. There is also the possibility of more than two rides, as the system does not restrict usage; members may take additional trips during midday or for other errands.

#### 2 Company Given Fact: 
While many Cyclistic users ride for leisure, an estimated 30% use the bikes to commute to work on a daily basis. This benchmark‚Äîwhether referring to 30% of total utilization or 30% of the fleet size (5,824 bikes)‚Äîhelps anchor our assumptions about member behavior and system demand during peak hours.

#### 3 Estimating Ride Frequency of Members

This inference allows us to estimate the probable number of unique members in the system. Given:

  - 713,073 total member rides  
  - 120 days from Jan 1 to April 30
  - 2 frequency of ride
  
| Ride Frequency/Day | Estimated Members                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 2 rides/day        | 713,073 / (120 √ó 2) = **2,971**   |
| 3 rides/day        | 713,073 / (120 √ó 3) = **1,980**   |
| 3.5 rides/day      | 713,073 / (120 √ó 3.5) = **1,698** |


#### 4 Estimating Active Members from Fleet Utilization

If **30% of the fleet** is regularly used by members for commuting‚Äîbased on Cyclistic‚Äôs internal benchmark‚Äîthen we estimate:

- **30% of 5,824 bikes = 1,747 members**

This estimated member base aligns closely with the calculated range based on actual ride behavior.

Given:
- **713,073 total member rides** from January 1 to April 30 (120 days)

We calculate the average ride frequency per member:

\[
\text{Ride Frequency} = \frac{713{,}073}{120 \times 1{,}747} \approx \textbf{3.4 rides/day}
\]

This suggests the **average member rides about 3.4 times per day**, which supports the observed commuting patterns. It also implies that many members are taking more than two rides daily‚Äînot just morning and evening commutes, but also midday trips or errands.

#### 5 Estimated Revenue Comparison

With an estimated member count and known pricing structures, we can now compare revenue between rider types. Here, we use a normalized annual membership rate of **$120.00** and rate of **$0.15** per minute for single journey (casual) based on the average from Cyclistic's three comparable cities.


**Note:** Casual rider revenue is scalable based on activity. Member revenue is fixed, regardless of usage.

This highlights a key strategic consideration: **members ride more frequently and consume more fleet resources, yet generate less revenue per ride.**

```{r Comparative revenue, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

revenue_table <- data.frame(
  Category = c(
    "Pricing Benchmark",
    "Total Ride Minutes (Jan‚ÄìApr 2025)",
    "Estimated Revenue (Jan‚ÄìApr 2025)",
    "Annual Revenue Projection",
    "Fleet Constraint",
    "Cost-Revenue Disconnect"
  ),
  Casual_Riders = c(
    "$0.15 per minute",
    "13,604,428 minutes",
    "~$2.04 million",
    "~$5 million/year",
    "Use available bikes when not occupied by members",
    "Revenue grows with usage"
  ),
  Member_Riders = c(
    "$120/year (~$0.33/day)",
    "17,202,236 minutes",
    "1,747 √ó $120 = ~$79,240/year (~$26,400 in 4 months)",
    "~$79,240/year (capped)",
    "Max 5,824 bikes; high membership risks saturation",
    "Ride more, but revenue is fixed"
  )
)

kable(revenue_table, format = "html", caption = "Revenue Comparison Summary: Casual vs. Member Riders") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

**üí° Notes on Revenue Estimation**

1. **Day passes were excluded** from this estimate. They represent a minority of users and do not significantly affect overall revenue patterns.

2. The calculation **focuses on traditional bikes**. While **e-bike usage increases the per-minute rate for casuals**, the **annual member fee for e-bike access rises more moderately**, widening the revenue gap further.

3. The **annual projection accounts for seasonality**, balancing summer peaks and winter lulls.

4. **Even doubling the current subscriber base would not match the revenue generated by casual riders**‚Äîthe pay-per-ride model scales more directly with usage.

5. To match casual rider revenue, Cyclistic would need over **17,000 annual members**‚Äîan unrealistic target given the **fleet constraint of 5,824 bikes**.

### II. Additional Insights

üí° **Strategic Insight**  
‚ÄúCasual riders operate under a pay-per-use model‚Äîrevenue scales with activity.  
Members are on a flat-rate model‚Äîrevenue is fixed no matter how much they ride.  
Converting high-usage casuals into members means trading scalable income for capped returns.‚Äù

üß≠ **Important Note on Member Value**  
While members may not maximize short-term revenue, they hold **intangible value** as brand ambassadors. Their visibility throughout the city increases Cyclistic‚Äôs presence, credibility, and social proof.  
Memberships should be **optimized‚Äînot eliminated**‚Äîensuring they align with fleet capacity and strategic priorities.
